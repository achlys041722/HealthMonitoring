# Data Isolation Fixes - Health-Integrated Student Information System

## **üîí Problem Identified**
The system was showing shared data across all schools instead of properly isolating data by school, making it feel like a shared account system.

## **‚úÖ Fixes Implemented**

### **1. Principal Dashboard (`templates/principal/principal_dashboard.php`)**
- **Fixed:** Recent activities query was showing all principal notifications
- **Solution:** Changed query to only show notifications for the specific principal (`WHERE n.user_id = ? AND n.user_role = "principal"`)
- **Result:** Principals now only see their own school's activities

### **2. Principal Health Records (`templates/principal/health_records.php`)**
- **Fixed:** Was showing health records from ALL schools
- **Solution:** Added proper school filtering:
  - Get principal's school information
  - Filter grades by school only
  - Filter students by school only
- **Result:** Principals only see health records from their assigned school

### **3. Nurse Health Records (`templates/nurse/health_records.php`)**
- **Fixed:** Was showing health records from ALL schools
- **Solution:** Added proper school filtering:
  - Get nurse's assigned schools from `nurse_requests` table
  - Filter dropdown to only show assigned schools
  - Filter charts and data by assigned schools only
- **Result:** Nurses only see health records from schools they're assigned to

### **4. Nurse Dashboard (`templates/nurse/nurse_dashboard.php`)**
- **Fixed:** Was only showing data from one assigned school
- **Solution:** Updated to show data from ALL assigned schools:
  - Get all schools assigned to nurse
  - Use `IN` clause to filter by multiple school IDs
  - Show school name in recent assessments
- **Result:** Nurses see comprehensive data from all their assigned schools

### **5. Teacher My Students (`templates/teacher/my_students.php`)**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Already properly filtered
- **Current:** Teachers only see students from their assigned grade level
- **No changes needed**

### **6. Principal Notifications (`templates/principal/notifications.php`)**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Already properly filtered
- **Current:** Principals only see their own notifications and teacher requests
- **No changes needed**

## **üîê Data Isolation Rules Implemented**

### **Principal Access:**
- ‚úÖ Only their assigned school's students
- ‚úÖ Only their assigned school's health records
- ‚úÖ Only their assigned school's teachers
- ‚úÖ Only their own notifications and activities

### **Teacher Access:**
- ‚úÖ Only their assigned grade level's students
- ‚úÖ Only their assigned grade level's health records
- ‚úÖ Only their own notifications

### **Nurse Access:**
- ‚úÖ Only assigned schools' students
- ‚úÖ Only assigned schools' health records
- ‚úÖ Only assigned schools' activities
- ‚úÖ Can see data from multiple schools if assigned to multiple

## **üìä Database Queries Fixed**

### **Before (Shared Data):**
```sql
-- Principal Health Records (WRONG)
SELECT * FROM students s 
JOIN grade_levels gl ON s.grade_level_id = gl.id 
-- No school filtering!

-- Nurse Health Records (WRONG)
SELECT * FROM students s 
JOIN grade_levels gl ON s.grade_level_id = gl.id 
-- No assigned school filtering!
```

### **After (Isolated Data):**
```sql
-- Principal Health Records (CORRECT)
SELECT * FROM students s 
JOIN grade_levels gl ON s.grade_level_id = gl.id 
WHERE gl.school_id = ? -- Principal's school only

-- Nurse Health Records (CORRECT)
SELECT * FROM students s 
JOIN grade_levels gl ON s.grade_level_id = gl.id 
WHERE gl.school_id IN (?, ?, ?) -- Only assigned schools
```

## **üéØ Security Benefits**

1. **Data Privacy:** Each school's data is completely isolated
2. **Access Control:** Users only see what they're authorized to see
3. **Multi-School Support:** Nurses can work with multiple schools while maintaining isolation
4. **Audit Trail:** All activities are properly scoped to user's permissions

## **‚úÖ Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Principal can only see their school's students
- [ ] Principal can only see their school's health records
- [ ] Principal can only see their own notifications
- [ ] Teacher can only see their grade level's students
- [ ] Nurse can only see assigned schools' data
- [ ] Nurse can see multiple schools if assigned to multiple
- [ ] No cross-school data leakage

## **üöÄ Result**
The system now properly isolates data by school, ensuring each elementary school's data is kept separate and secure. Users only see data they're authorized to access based on their role and school assignments.
